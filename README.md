# Why programming?

I was in the middle school, when I had my first IT classes. I especially got fond of crunching through different algorithms and solving problems. 
That was the reason why I have chosen IT. But there is also something more in programming and it's about creation.
You are given the chance to create something unique and whether is that a short program, game or web application.
After completing something there is always some deep satisfaction coming with it.

This is the reason why I have chosen programming :computer:.
